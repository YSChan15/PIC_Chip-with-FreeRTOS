# PIC Chip with Free RTOS
## Summary
-  This project uses PIC24 microcontroller chip to perform temperature measurements, driving RGB LEDs, and sending / receiving commands from GUI.

-  This project utilizes ADC (Analog to Digital Conversion) for measuring temperatures with LM35, OC (Oscillator Configuration) to drive RGB LED, and UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) for communication between the PIC microcontroller and PC.

-  Free RTOS is used as there's various tasks that needs to be performed by the PIC chip at a different time.

## Hardware required 
-  PIC24 microcontroller chip
-  MPLAB PIC Kit 4 Debugger
-  Tri-Color RGB LED
-  Bluetooth Module
-  LED 
-  Resistor
-  Capacitor
